Utils -
	Command Runner now actually kills timed out forked processes. 
	Added bamToFastq.py and fixed bamToFastq so that it
		reverse-compliments sequences
	BamStat.py now has a prettier report and can read from sys.stdin
		(e.g. samtools view input.bam 15:19428-19692 | BamStat.py)
PBHoney
	Spots has been refactored to be faster, more informative, and a 
		more accurate
	Spots now calls a consensus and gets a more accurate breakpoint. 
	Spots also reports strand counts
	Spots also is a little faster, though I also made a method that is
		optional to use that goes much slower but is much cleaner 
		pysam code.
	Spots now throws in genotype information (incorrect format, though)
	Removed recallSpots.py.  this is now inside of Honey.py spots with 
		--hon option
	Extreme Multiprocessing -- PBHoney is now multiprocessed and has
		splitting options with the --chrom parameter. 
	Tails and spots checks sort order and throws up some warning
	bampie now adds PG information to your output.tails.bam header
	Tails now uses default buffer of 1kb
	Tails now looks to see if Bread.anno == Bread.anno before clustering.
	This should prevent the '*' complex behavior
	Mapping through pie uses different defualt blasr parameters
	Mapping through pie has utility for running the initial mapping step
		including creating chunks for you (see docs for details)

PBJelly 
	Setup no longer has the noRename option.

Coming Soon:
	Begin using pyvcf... I'll be outputing proper vcfs soon

	Using SAM mate information properly (e.g. adding the fields for next)
		PpPiPeIpIiIeEpEiEe
	
	PBHoneySpots -- Don't allow MapQ below <threshold> count for [COV|CON]
	
	Merging Spots/Tails Calling (keep modules separate, but allow a
				     joint-calling procedure)
