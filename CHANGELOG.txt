Utils -
	Command Runner now actually kills timed out forked processes. 
PBHoney
	Spots has been refactored to be faster, more informative, and a little
		more accurate
	Spots now calls a consensus and gets a more accurate breakpoint. 
	Spots also does strand counts, which will help resolve the tandem
		issue.
	Spots also is a little faster, though I also made a method that is
		optional to use that goes much slower but is much cleaner 
		pysam code.
	Spots now throws in genotype information (incorrect format, though)
	Removed recallSpots.py.  this is now inside of Honey.py spots with 
		--hon option
	Begain using pyvcf... I'll be outputing proper vcfs soon
	Extreme Multiprocessing -- PBHoney is now multiprocessed and has
		splitting options with the --chrom parameter. 
	Tails and spots checks sort order and throws up some warning
