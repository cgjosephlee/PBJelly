Utils -
	Command Runner now actually kills timed out forked processes. 
	Added bamToFastq.py and fixed bamToFastq so that it
		reverse-compliments sequences
	BamStat.py now has a prettier report and can read from sys.stdin
		(e.g. samtools view input.bam 15:19428-19692 | BamStat.py)

PBHoney
	Spots has been refactored to be faster, more informative, and a 
		more accurate
	Spots now calls a consensus and gets a more accurate breakpoint. 
	Spots also reports strand counts
	Spots also faster, though I also made a method that is optional 
		to use that goes much slower but is much cleaner pysam code.
	Spots now throws in genotype information 
	Removed recallSpots.py.  this is now inside of Honey.py spots with 
		--hon option
	Extreme Multiprocessing -- PBHoney is now multiprocessed and has
		splitting options with the --chrom parameter. 
	Tails and spots checks sort order and throws up some warning
	bampie now adds PG information to your output.tails.bam header
	Tails now uses default buffer of 1kb
	Tails now looks to see if Bread.anno == Bread.anno before clustering.
	This should prevent the '*' complex behavior
	Mapping through pie uses different defualt blasr parameters
	Mapping through pie has utility for running the initial mapping step
		including creating chunks for you (see docs for details)
	Spots now has the option of producing a readFile
	Spots doesn't allow MapQ below --minMapQ count for discovery or
		refinement
	ComplexResolver -- Overlapping tail events are often indicative of a
		more complex sample structure. This program resolves those
		break-points to find a non-local annotation of the sample's
		structure
	Tails is now more memory efficient by parsing per-chromosome
	Spots/Force now uses sizes and a delta to and collapse for potentially
		spurious matches
	
    Spots is now a little faster thanks to the collapse described above
    Spots now reports a z-score for the significance of the intra-read
        discordance that led to the spot's evaluation
    
PBJelly 
	Setup no longer has the noRename option.
	Fixed bug in Extraction.py when a networkx version number like "1.9.1"
		would break the code
	Added parameter to Collection.py so that the min-gap size (gapInflate)
		can be set (by default it has been 25)

ToDo/Coming Soon:
	Complex Resolver Documentation
	
	Need to split when you make subdirectories for gaps.
	
    	Pie automatically loading unmapped reads into your .sam/.bam
	
	Begin using pyvcf... I'll be outputing proper vcfs soon

	Using SAM mate information properly (e.g. adding the fields for next)
		PpPiPeIpIiIeEpEiEe
	
	Merging Spots/Tails Calling (keep modules separate, but allow a
				     joint-calling procedure)
	
	Haplotyping 
	
	Easy/well documented Annotation Pipeline
	
	Improve Force results format

	All documentation needs to be improved. Honey is pretty complex now.
