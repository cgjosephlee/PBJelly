I need to test that it will work and then I need to work on resolving redundancies in the code - an artifact from not organizing everything earlier

I need that quick script for reanalyzing data

I need to fix the inf problem for the errMatRatio when we have 0 matches...

I need to finish fully characterizing the ecoli dataset. I am getting this
right, but I'm probably missing things and I'm definitely getting too much.
